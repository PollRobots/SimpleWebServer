# Simple Web Server

This implements a very simple web server in C#, both as a standalone program
and as a class library.

To run the server, simply provide a port number and a root directory.

**Note** This is not intended to be a production tool. I use this when
tinkering with html, js etc. to simplify by personal development cycle.
